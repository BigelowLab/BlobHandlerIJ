notes for BlobHandler

speed:

BlobHandler is slower than ParticleAnalyzer - try analyzing the sample image
"Particles" using Analyzer and BlobHandler.  It gest slower still if "Combine
if Closer" Than is anything but zero.  I don't find that it is annoyingly slow.  

crack boundary vs. perimeter pixels:
Inner and and outer boundaries are computed and stored two ways.  (1) the the upper-left coordinates
of boundary pixels define the pixel boundary and (2) the interpixel path between pixels define the 
"crack" boundary.  The former is derived from the original scan using the CCL algorithm. It is used for 
estimating the volume of objects when the SVW (Sieracki,Viles and Webb (1989)) biovolume method is used.
The latter is computed using a slight adaptation of ImageJ's Wand.  The crack boundary is used for 
all other computations of shape, etc.
  

to do:

- [done, 2010-4-07] add optional crack boundary?
- add more affine moment invariants from new book?
- greyscale moment invariants?
- separate hu and ami invariants?
- add rois to ROI manager?
- [done, 2010-02-27] option to size filter before/after combine?
